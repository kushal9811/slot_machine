# Slot Machine Project

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project implementing a slot machine interface. Users can adjust the speed of the slot machine spinning animation using an input field.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

- Adjust the speed of the slot machine spinning animation using the input field labeled "Speed".
- The slot machine displays three slots, each containing an emoji. These emojis change randomly as the machine spins.
- The spinning animation speed is controlled by the user input. Higher values make the animation faster.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the slot machine.
- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for handling the slot machine animation and user input.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS code for styling the slot machine interface.

## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies. It only uses HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript.
